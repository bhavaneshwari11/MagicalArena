Magical Arena Java Program
This is a Java program for simulating battles between players in a magical arena. Each player is defined by their health, strength, and attack attributes, and battles are conducted using dice rolls to determine attack and defense outcomes.

Instructions:
1. Compilation:
To compile the Java program, follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the Java source files (Main.java, Player.java, Game.java, Dice.java).
Use the javac command to compile all Java source files. For example:
bash
Copy code
javac Main.java Player.java Game.java Dice.java
Upon successful compilation, you should see corresponding .class files generated for each .java file.
2. Running the Program:
To run the compiled Java program, follow these steps:

Ensure that you're in the same directory containing the compiled .class files.
Use the java command followed by the name of the main class (without the .class extension) to execute the program. For example:
bash
Copy code
java Main
Follow any on-screen instructions or provide input as required by the program.
Additional Information:
Classpath: If your program depends on other classes or external libraries, you might need to specify the classpath using the -cp or -classpath option when running the java command. For example:

bash
Copy code
java -cp . Main
This command includes the current directory (.) in the classpath.

Java Version: Make sure you're using a compatible version of Java to compile and run your program. You can check your Java version using the command java -version.

Error Handling: If you encounter any errors during compilation or execution, carefully read the error messages to understand the issue. Common errors include syntax errors, missing classes, and incorrect classpath settings.
